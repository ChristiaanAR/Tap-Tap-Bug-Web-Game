Tap Tap Bug

Basics:
The basic goal of this game is to stop the ants from eating your food by squashing them before it's too late!
This is accomplished by tapping on them before they reach the food.

Rules:

      -60 seconds pass
      -all 5 pieces of food are eaten
      -when the game ends, display score and show two buttons: restart or exit game
      
  -Food:
    -start with 5 pieces (only spawn on bottom half of screen?)
    -disappear as soon as ants reach them
    
  -Types of ants:
      -black: fast (150px/sec), worth 5 points, 0.3 probability of appearing
      -red: medium (75px/sec), worth 3 points, 0.3 probability of appearing
      -orange: slow (60px/sec), worth 1 point, 0.4 probability of appearing
      -all ants spawn at the top of the screen and head straight to the nearest food
      -once a food is eaten, all ants previously headed to that food will now head to the nearest uneaten food
      -new bugs enter every 1 to 3 seconds
      -level 2 increases move speed of ants
      -taps within a radius of 30px kills an ant
