Tap Tap Bug

Basics:
The basic goal of this game is to stop the ants from eating your food by squashing them before it's too late!
This is accomplished by tapping on them before they reach the food.

Rules:
  -Game ends if:
      -60 seconds pass
      -all 5 pieces of food are eaten
      -when the game ends, display score and show two buttons: restart or exit game
      
  -Food:
    -start with 5 pieces (only spawn on bottom half of screen?)
    -disappear as soon as ants reach them
    
  -Types of ants:
      -black: fast (150px/sec), worth 5 points, 0.3 probability of appearing
      -red: medium (75px/sec), worth 3 points, 0.3 probability of appearing
      -orange: slow (60px/sec), worth 1 point, 0.4 probability of appearing
      -all ants spawn at the top of the screen and head straight to the nearest food
      -once a food is eaten, all ants previously headed to that food will now head to the nearest uneaten food
      -new bugs enter every 1 to 3 seconds
      -level 2 increases move speed of ants
      -taps within a radius of 30px kills an ant

Design:
  -Main Screen:
    -buttons to select level 1 or level 2
    -show high score for the currently selected level
    -start button that starts the game when pressed
  
  -Game Canvas
    -timer with countdown from 60
    -pause button (centered in info bar)
    -when paused stop movement of ants and replace pause button with play button

    -Game Canvas:
      -600px height by 400px view port, info bar is additional
